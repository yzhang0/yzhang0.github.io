                        &nbsp; &nbsp; After a difficult term at the university of Waterloo, I was afraid to code any middle size project by myself.
                        The brutal CS courses made me want to flee any kind of intensive keyboard interaction. As such, I leeched on FLowing Data for months
                        before trying my hand at data visualization... coding suddenly became fun again.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I was fortunate enough to have a fellow Data Vis enthusiast as manager at IBM, who encouraged me to keep learning about this
                        amazing library. In winter 2016, I created two projects with D3: a <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/yuaz/63a5bfa2faa06ae40141b7a9dd7e6120" style="color:#ff5500;">simple scatterplot</a>
                        (inspired by Hans Rosling's demographic chart) and a dynamic <a href="mangas.html" style="color:#ff5500;">bubble chart</a>
                        (following an amazing tutorial by Jim Vallandigha).

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; As an avid manga reader I was surprised by the lack of reliable data visualization about this form of literature.
