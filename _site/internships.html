                        Determine which tech companies are the most popular and which tech company internships are the most desired
                        among university of Waterloo students. Keep reading below to find out which companies you should apply next!
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Scraping</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        I always wanted to use an API for my data visualization projects. After talking to a few people,
                        it seems like Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and the Postman application are the most common
                        ways to call an API and build a dataset. I really like this <a href="http://vlyubin.pythonanywhere.com/waterloo_raw" style="color:#ff5500;">
                        dataset</a> by Vlyubin which is why I decided
                        to skip the data scraping step. I wanted to fetch my own data from the Linkedin API but it disabled profile look up on their API in 2015.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        First, some information about the dataset. In Vlyubin's own words, "Only students who started in 2010 to
                        2013 (inclusive) and did at least 2 internships with industry being Computer Software or Internet at
                        university of Waterloo are considered.
                        This data was collected in August 2015 and contains 2392 students."
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="section_title" style="color:#CC6699;font-family:'Lobster Two';">Part 1: Interactive Chart of Companies </h3>
                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Preparation</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        The dataset was saved in a text file. I used readLines() in R to parse it into a dataframe and
                        gsub() to remove random whitespace and confusing substrings. Then, I looked at what the dataset contains.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/yzhang0/4e613e01da50400f447d4de0bd287962.js"></script>

                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Exploration</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        First, we need to understand our data. Based on the code snippet above, it seems a lot of students have not
                        graduated yet. Out of 2392 students, 934 haven't even completed their fourth coop! For the goal of this simple
                        data visualization, it is not a big deal. However, I would be more restrictive in my next data collecting.
                        Let's see which companies hire the most students!
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/yzhang0/08ecb9ac7fb19d206c775cbba452fe97.js"></script>
                    <img src="../img/graph3.jpeg">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Awesome! Now, let's do one more quick visualization before turning to D3! Let's see which are the most popular
                        five companies for each term. It seems like Blackberry hires a lot of sophomores and freshmen whereas Facebook
                        hires a lot of Senior students.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Visualization</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Next: D3! I used this <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/ccmcc/5182685" style="color:#CC6699;">tutorial</a> by CCMCC
                    to understand how the nodes and edges in a force layout should be generated using D3. Then, based on previous
                    knowledge and a lot of help from Stack Overflow, I slowly built my project.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s1.jpeg">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    First draft in green! The nodes represent how many students worked at this company and the edges represent where else
                    some of those students worked at. To prevent overloading the chart with information, I decided to only keep companies
                    which hired more than 15 students: there was 86 of them.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s2.jpeg">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    I then realized the chart looks a lot better in black. I also modified the size of the nodes to something easier to click.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s3.png">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    I added an interactive table on the right. For each click on a company, it shows the 5 companies that hired the most coop students from it
                    (represented by positive rate) and the 5 companies who provided the largest number of interns to it
                    (represented by negative rate). For example, if Google hired a student who worked at IBM two terms ago, the rate of IBM when
                    clicked on Google will increase by 2.
                    And to make it interesting, I added some colors to go with this dashboard. Here are how these colors are categorized.
                    <table style="width:100%">
                        <tr>

                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <h3 class="section_title" style="color:#CC6699;font-family:'Lobster Two';">Part 2: Predict Future Internship </h3>
                    <h4 class="section_title">Problem Definition</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Determine the top 10 companies a student should apply to given their past experiences using supervised learning.
                    To challenge myself and learn something new, I will use an ensemble Model in Python as I am studying a
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python" style="color:#ff5500;">kernel</a> about
                    it this week.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Preparation</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    I am aware there is a lack of features which I need to train my model as all I have
                    is a list of company names for each student. I want to extract as much value out of it as I can.
                    <br>
                    1. Clean the features by capitalizing the first letter of each company name only, removing duplicate students,
                    anything after a punctuation, ending space, between parenthesis, "Inc.", "Ltd." etc. This allows us to have a
                    smaller number of categories and ultimately increase the performance of the model and prevent overfitting. By adding this step,
                    I was able to remove 260 companies from the total number of unique companies (3560 => 3360).
                    <br>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s7.png">
                    <br>
                    2. I know I can do better though. I remember reading a <a href="http://www.datasketch.es/december/" style="color:#ff5500;">data scraping project</a>
                    by Nadiah where she replaced strings by another if the exact string can be found in it, string that are the same except for up to 2 characters,
                    and compared the matching to more standardized lists. This can be particularly useful since I see a lot of "IBM" and "IBM Canada" for example.
                    By adding this step, I was able to go down by 372 companies (3360 => 2988)!
                    <br>
                    3. Create one data point for each internship excluding the first term. For example, if a student
                    worked at ABC in T1, XXX in T2, and RTC in T3, then he/she would get the following data points:
                    <br>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s5.png">
                    <br>
                    3. Add a few numerical features to the data set to quantify the companies. Here, I am simply checking how many times
                    each company appeared in each term. I decided to count how many 'None' in each term since this information is useful.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s6.png">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now that I have my base features, I realize another problem in the project. There is no way I can give my
                    model 3400 values for each feature; it is too sparse! It does not take into consideration enough scenarios
                    and wouldn't be able to predict future data points correctly. I can attempt to solve it by adding more training data
                    (not available), group companies under larger categories (requires web scraping), improve my data cleaning (not worth the 80/20 time spent at
                    the moment) or derive more features. One way to do the latter is to see the data as a directed graph (which we did in part 1) and derive features from it.
                    This is an interesting idea and I will look into it for future enhancements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also realized there is no way to carry the information from each company at each step as it implies duplicating the same
                    work six times... a lot of boilerplate. I decided to build two models: one predicting the "attractiveness"
                    of each company and one predicting the top 10 companies depending on previous placements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To get more information for each company, I decided to leverage one of the followings: Linkedin, Glassdoor or Wikipedia. The main features I want to
                    extract are the location of each company (both country and city), number of employees, salary, work culture,
                    type of company (tech, banking, finance, health, government), employees satisfaction, etc. I will try Glassdoor first.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This step took a lot of time as I am not very used to web development. Since Glassdoor add an unique id to each company in the
                    URL, I had to use the selenium library in Python. I decided to perform my data scraping in two steps: (1) Retrieve the link of each
                    company and (2) Retrieve the information of each company. Here is a skeleton of my vision:
