                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Scraping</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        I always wanted to use an API for my data visualization projects. After talking to a few people,
                        it seems like Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and the Postman application are the most common
                        ways to call an API and build a dataset. I really like this <a href="http://vlyubin.pythonanywhere.com/waterloo_raw" style="color:#ff5500;">
                        dataset</a> by Vlyubin which is why I decided
                        to skip the data scraping step. However, if time allows, I plan to create a more recent dataset or
                        in a different field (data science? financial jobs? actuarial sciences?) to learn the Linkedin API.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        First, some information about the dataset. In Vlyubin's own words, "Only students who started in 2010 to
                        2013 (inclusive) and did at least 2 internships with industry being Computer Software or Internet are considered.
                        This data was collected in August 2015 and contains 2392 students."
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Preparation</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        The dataset was saved in a text file. I used readLines() in R to parse it into a dataframe and
                        gsub() to remove random whitespace and confusing substrings. Then, I looked at what the dataset contains.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Exploration</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        First, we need to understand our data. Based on the code snippet above, it seems a lot of students have not
                        graduated yet. Out of 2392 students, 934 haven't even completed their fourth coop! For the goal of this simple
                        data visualization, it is not a big deal. However, I would be more restrictive in my next data collecting.
                        Let's see which companies hire the most students!
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/yzhang0/08ecb9ac7fb19d206c775cbba452fe97.js"></script>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Awesome! Now, let's do one more quick visualization before turning to D3! Let's see which are the most popular
                        five companies for each term. It seems like Blackberry hires a lot of sophomores and freshmen whereas Facebook
                        hires a lot of Senior students.

                        Next: D3! Since this post is getting quite long, I created a <a href="internships2.html" style="color:#ff5500;">part two</a>.
