                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi there, this is Yuan!
                        I grew up in Montreal, Canada and moved to Waterloo to pursue a joint degree in Computer Science and Statistics in 2015.
                        I have <a style="background-color: Yellow;" href="travels.html">TRAVELED</a> to 15 new cities and learnt so much about myself.
                        There are a lot of things I <a style="background-color: Yellow;" href="likes.html">LOVE</a> and want to do.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy working on data projects during my free time and polishing my programming skills.
                        <br>
