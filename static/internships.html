                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Scraping</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        I always wanted to use an API for my data visualization projects. After talking to a few people,
                        it seems like Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and the Postman application are the most common
                        ways to call an API and build a dataset. I really like this <a href="http://vlyubin.pythonanywhere.com/waterloo_raw" style="color:#ff5500;">
                        dataset</a> by Vlyubin which is why I decided
                        to skip the data scraping step. However, if time allows, I plan to create a more recent dataset or
                        in a different field (data science? financial jobs? actuarial sciences?) to learn the Linkedin API.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        First, some information about the dataset. In Vlyubin's own words, "Only students who started in 2010 to
                        2013 (inclusive) and did at least 2 internships with industry being Computer Software or Internet are considered.
                        This data was collected in August 2015 and contains 2392 students."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Preparation</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        The dataset was saved in a text file. I used readLines() in R to parse it into a dataframe and
                        gsub() to remove random whitespace and confusing substrings. Then, I looked at what the dataset contains.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Exploration</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        First, we need to understand our data. Based on the code snippet above, it seems a lot of students have not
                        graduated yet. Out of 2392 students, 934 haven't even completed their fourth coop! For the goal of this simple
                        data visualization, it is not a big deal. However, I would be more restrictive in my next data collecting.
                        Let's see which companies hire the most students!
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/yzhang0/08ecb9ac7fb19d206c775cbba452fe97.js"></script>
                    <img src="../img/graph3.jpeg">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Awesome! Now, let's do one more quick visualization before turning to D3! Let's see which are the most popular
                        five companies for each term. It seems like Blackberry hires a lot of sophomores and freshmen whereas Facebook
                        hires a lot of Senior students.
                    </p>

                    <img src="../img/graph2.jpeg">

                    <h4 class="section_title">Data Visualization</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Next: D3! I used this <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/ccmcc/5182685" style="color:#ff5500;">tutorial</a> by CCMCC
                    to understand how the nodes and edges in a force layout should be generated using D3. Then, based on previous
                    knowledge and a lot of help from Stack Overflow, I slowly built my project.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s1.jpeg">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    First draft in green! The nodes represent how many students worked at this company and the edges represent where else
                    some of those students worked at.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s2.jpeg">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    I then realized the chart looks a lot better in black. I also modified the size of the nodes to something less sparse.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../img/internship_s3.png">
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Added an interactive dashboard on the right of the 5 companies who hired the most coop students from this company
                    (represented by positive rate) and the 5 companies who provided the largest number of interns to the company
                    (represented by negative rate). If Google hired a student who worked at IBM two terms ago, the rate of IBM when
                    clicked on Google will increase by 2.
                    And to make it interesting, I added some colors to go with this dashboard. Here are how these colors are categorized.
