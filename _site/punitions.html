<h3 class="posts">What makes a punition effective from a sociological point of view?</h3>
<div style="margin:30px">
  <p>[Post under construction]</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Maybe it is my Asian background speaking; but from a young age, I had a low
    key obsession with the concept of punishments. Do parents always have the higher
    moral ground and do they have the right to punish their children? My answer alternated
    between yes and no to the first question but I never dared give a second thought to the
    last one. I bore my injustices and went back to be the little kid I am at heart.
    The concept got even more interesting as I moved into high school. I slowly discovered kids are
    not the only ones been punished. The whole world unfold before my eyes. From crime of passion to rape
    to corporate crime, more crimes are accomplished on a daily base than I can wrap my head around.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, it is still a concept very hard to gasp for me. I never really committed a crime. I have never been
    victim to an injustice that I couldn’t brush off. So, does my point of view bring any value to this already
    so controversial topic? Can I really say “For 30 Millions dollars, this guy deserves 20 years and not 10.”
    Do I really understand the weight of such huge numbers to make a clear judgement? The concept of punishment
    kept coming back. I took two courses in college that forged my interest in this topic:
    Greek Philosophy and Women, Art and Society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trials are a sequence of facts, one event after another, building up to a consequence that always felt underwhelming.
    In my eyes, no real problem is really solved. Society rarely changed after a case. The people mourning are still
    mourning. And the offender, did something even change within him? As a problem solver, I thought those solutions
    were bland. Punishments have always been an integral part of bigger problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today’s rape culture is something most people are aware. It is one of those cases where the law is broken.
    Most real occurrences of rape are left untold since the victim has more to lose than the offender. Made up
    occurrences are hard to refute. Consequences fall off as underwhelming. All that remains is social pressure
    and the hot debates we find online.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rape happens because, for even one second, a person think they hold the power in their hand to put a
    fellow human being beneath themselves. Whether it is under influence, based on past experience, or
    anger against the society as a whole… when there are means, there are ways. Because violence has no reason.
    It is a rush to the head, a need to take action… no matter what the action is. Murderers silence their victims
    in fear of punishment. Rapist dominates their victims in fear of reality. They act based on a sin. They stand in the dark.
