                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi there! I'm Yuan, a Statistics student with a Minor in Computer Sciences at the University of Waterloo.
                        I am involved in volunteering activities since elementary school and have participated in multiple cultural programs such as RotarAct and YMCA.
                        I am a genuine person who cares about the future of each endeavor.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy working on data projects during my free time and polishing my programming skills.
                        Currently, I am learning the ropes of data visualization and data science.
                        <br>
